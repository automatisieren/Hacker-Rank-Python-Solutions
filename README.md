# HackerRank Python Solutions

This repo includes the answers of all questions published under the name 'Preparation for Python' on HackerRank
#### Attention
- It's mainly comprised of Python 3 code, yet one can see Python 2 on some parts, too
- The repo doesn't include the questions, so I hope you can find the corresponding answer by searching relevant keywords
- Reach me out in case some errors are spotted

I really hope this repo is of some help for those who are in need
